## Key Features

### 1. Two Modes: Seller & Buyer

The platform allows users to choose between two roles: Seller and Buyer. Sellers can post their service Plans, while Buyers can post Offers to seek services from Sellers.

### 2. Seller's Plans

Sellers can showcase their skills and expertise by posting Plans on the platform. These Plans outline the services they offer, pricing, and delivery timelines.

### 3. Buyer's Offers

Buyers can post Offers to express their requirements and expectations. Offers include project details, budget, and any specific terms.

### 4. Blockchain-based User Authentication

The platform ensures robust security through blockchain-based user authentication. User identities are protected, ensuring a safe and trustworthy environment for all participants.

### 5. Smart Contracts for Delivery Competition

Smart contracts are utilized to facilitate fair competition among Sellers. When multiple Sellers bid on the same Offer, smart contracts automatically manage the selection process based on predefined criteria.

### 6. Automated Smart Contract Creation on Plan Acceptance

Upon a Buyer's acceptance of a Plan, an automated smart contract is created. This contract governs the terms and conditions of the project, ensuring transparent and secure transactions.

## How It Works

1. Sellers register and choose the Seller mode to post their Plans.

2. Buyers register and select the Buyer mode to post Offers for the required services.

3. Smart contracts manage the competition between Sellers vying for the same Offer.

4. Upon the Buyer's acceptance of a Plan, an automated smart contract is created for the project.

5. The project proceeds, and upon successful completion, the smart contract ensures timely and accurate payments to the Seller.

## Future Developments
