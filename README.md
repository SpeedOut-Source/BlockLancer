## Key Features

### 1. Two Modes/Roles: Seller & Buyer

The platform allows users to choose between two roles: 
**Seller and Buyer**. 
Sellers can post their service Plans, while Buyers can post Offers to seek services from Sellers.

### 2. Seller's Plan / Bids

Sellers can showcase their skills and expertise by posting Plans on the platform. These Plans outline the services they offer, pricing, and delivery timelines.

### 3. Buyer's Offers / Budgets 

Buyers can post Offers to express their requirements and expectations. Offers include project details, budget, and any specific terms.

### 4. Blockchain-based User Authentication

The platform ensures robust security through blockchain-based user authentication. User identities are protected, ensuring a safe and trustworthy environment for all participants.

### 5. Stellar Smart Contracts for Delivery Competition

Smart contracts are utilized to facilitate fair competition among Sellers. When multiple Sellers bid on the same Offer, smart contracts automatically manage the selection process based on predefined criteria.

### 6. Automated Token Exchange on Plan Acceptance

Upon a Buyer's acceptance of a Plan, an automated NFT is generated on the stellar Blockchain. This NFT works as a contract, which governs the terms and conditions of the project, ensuring transparent and secure transactions.

## How It Works

1. Sellers register and choose the Seller mode to post their Plans.

2. Buyers register and select the Buyer mode to post Offers for the required services.

3. Smart contracts manage the competition between Sellers vying for the same Offer.

4. Upon the Buyer's acceptance of a Plan, an automated smart contract is created for the project.

5. The project proceeds, and upon successful completion, the smart contract ensures timely and accurate payments to the Seller.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Efficiency:** The platform streamlines the freelance process, reducing manual interventions and enhancing overall efficiency.

- **Fair Competition:** Sellers have equal opportunities to secure projects through transparent and automated bidding. Since this will also push sellers to place their payment requests equal to other sellers, it provides fairness to the buyers as well.

- **Secure Transactions:** Stellar Blockchain (XLM) technology ensures secure and tamper-proof transactions, building trust among all users.

- **Authenticity:** Blockchain-based user authentication eliminates fake accounts, duplicate accounts and enhances the authenticity of users. We'll be using stellar wallets to authenticate users. On invitation based beta testing, we'll have the following wallets:
- Albedo
- Lobstr (Wallet Connect V2)
- Rabet
In future, there will be Google mail login and facebook login based Stellar Wallet system as well.

## Future Developments

The Digital Services Marketplace aims to further leverage blockchain's capabilities to introduce a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model for platform governance. This will allow stakeholders to actively participate in decision-making processes and shape the platform's future.
